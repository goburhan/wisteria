The Basic Sale has no participation fee.In the Unlimited Sale, there’s no limit to the amounts of RBS-BNB LP Tokens you can commit. However, there’s a fee for participation: see below.'

    q: 'Which sale should I commit? Can I do both?',
    a: 'You can choose one or both at the same time! If you’re only committing a small amount, we recommend the Basic Sale first.'
  },

    q: 'How much is the participation fee?',
    a: 'There’s only a participation fee for the Unlimited Sale: there’s no fee for the Basic Sale.The fee will start at 1%.The 1% participation fee decreases in cliffs, based on the percentage of overflow from the “Unlimited” portion of the sale.'

    q: 'Where does the participation fee go?',
    a: 'We burn it. The RBS-BNB LP tokens from the participation fee will be decomposed. We will then use the BNB portion to market buy the RBS equivalent, and finally throw all of the RBS into the weekly token burn.'
